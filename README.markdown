# MacroTracker
An macro tracking app that also serves as my initiation into the world of react native

## Overview
In the fitness community, it isn't enough to merely count our caloric intake and measure our weight. If we wish to cut fat, increase muscle, build strong bones, increase flexibility, and in general get healthier, we must also manage our other bodily intakes such as:

* proteins
* fats
* fiber
* vitamins
* processed sugars
* (if you're really crazy) anvar and roid cycles
* etc.

as well as track our exercise regiments for:

* duration
* sets
* etc.

However, pretty much every single modern health / fitness app nowadays is targeted towards the casual audience who only cares about "getting toned for summer". 

This app will be different. For one thing, it will be complexed and demand dedication; we will not tolerate casuals and NYRs who don't have the discipline to push through and commit.

## Features
This app will ship with 4 routes

### Home Route
Your reminders, progress summaries, and TODOs live here

### Progress Route
The progress route will have your entire tracked progress in all its different graphs and charts over time here. You'll be expected to key in your weight, body fat, etc., each day here.

- key in weight, bf, etc.,
- view your weight / time, bf / time, etc.,
- view all your metrics
- view recommended measuring devices
- take bathroom selfies of yourself as you make progress
- unlock accomplishments over time

### Diet Route
Here, you track your diet; key in your macros, track your calories, and presumably also take pictures of your food over time

- key in your target fiber, calories, etc., per meal
- key in your whatever it is you might eat outside scheduled meals
- key in your actual calories, fiber, proteins, etc., per meal
- assign pictures of your food to each meal card
- view recommendations for diet plans

### Exercise Route
Here, you track your exercise routines. You can mark your exercises as recurring reminders that pop-up each day and must be tackled (or made up, I suppose). All exercises are timed and can be broken down into the fine timing system those calithenstics Germans like (i.e. time descending, time holding at bottom, time going back up, time resting at top)

- create workouts and assign exercises to them
- detail target weight / timings to each exercise
- setup recurring frequency of each work-out
- perform each work-out as they become available
- attach videos / images to each exercise
- view recommended exercises
